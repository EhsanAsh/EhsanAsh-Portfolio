## Algorithm:

### 1. Project Initialization and Setup
- **Create Project Structure:**
  - Initialize a new React project using `create-react-app`.
  - Organize the project into folders for components, assets, and utilities.
- **Install Dependencies:**
  - Install React Router for navigation.
  - Add necessary UI libraries (e.g., Material-UI, Bootstrap) for styling.

### 2. Basic Layout and Navigation
- **Develop Basic Layout:**
  - Create a layout component with a header, main content area, and footer.
- **Implement Navigation:**
  - Set up React Router for single-page navigation.
  - Create a navigation bar in the header with links to different sections: About Me, Portfolio, Contact, and Resume.

### 3. About Me Section
- **Design and Implement:**
  - Display the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and a short bio.
  - Ensure this section is loaded by default when the portfolio is accessed.

### 4. Portfolio Section
- **Display Work Samples:**
  - Create a grid or list layout to showcase six projects.
  - Each project should have a title, image, and links to the deployed application and GitHub repository.

### 5. Contact Section
- **Create Contact Form:**
  - Implement a form with fields for name, email, and message.
  - Add client-side validation to ensure all fields are filled and the email address is valid.
  - Display notifications for validation errors.

### 6. Resume Section
- **Provide Resume and Skills:**
  - Include a link to download the developer's resume.
  - List the developer's key proficiencies and skills.

### 7. Footer with Social Links
- **Add Social Media Links:**
  - Include links or icons for GitHub, LinkedIn, and a third platform (e.g., Stack Overflow, Twitter).

### 8. Styling and Responsiveness
- **Apply Styles:**
  - Use CSS or a styling library to style components.
  - Ensure the design is responsive and works well on different screen sizes.

### 9. Testing and Validation
- **Perform Testing:**
  - Test the application across different browsers and devices.
  - Validate that all links and navigation work as expected.

### 10. Deployment
- **Prepare for Deployment:**
  - Build the React application for production.
- **Deploy the Application:**
  - Choose a hosting platform (e.g., Netlify, Vercel) and deploy the portfolio.
  - Test the deployed application to ensure it functions correctly.
